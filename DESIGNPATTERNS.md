#### What is design patterns?
**Software design principles are a set of guidelines that helps developers to make a good system design. The most important design principle are:**
- SOILD : It is combination of five basic designing principles.
    - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
        - This principle states that a class is responsible for one single purpose to change.
        - This principle is closely related to the concept of coupling.
    - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    - Liscov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)
    - This principle states that each small piece of code may only occur exactly once in the entire system. This helps to write scalable, maintainable and reusable code.
- KISS (Keep it simple, Stupid!)
- YAGNI (You ain't gonna need it)


> #### What are tight [coupling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-coupling-and-cohesion/)?
> - A relationship between two entities or class, they know **too much** about each other is a **tight coupled** relationship.
> - Binds two or more details together in a way that's difficult to change.
- - -

> #### What are loose [coupling aka decoupling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-coupling-and-cohesion/)?
> - A relationship between two entities or class, where they know **little** about each other is a **loosely coupled aka decoupled** relationship.
> - Offers a modular way to choose which details are involved in a particular operation.
- - -

> #### The benefit of loose coupling:
> - Having modularized and decoupled code make your code more understandable, testable, maintainable.
- - -

>#### What is [cohesion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-coupling-and-cohesion/)?
> Cohesion is the way functions, classes, and services are related together to deliver their purpose.
